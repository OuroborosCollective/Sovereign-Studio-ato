## 2025-05-28 - [Refactoring ProductMagicApp.tsx]
**Learning:** Large React components (200+ lines) with mixed state and UI benefit significantly from custom hooks and component decomposition.
**Action:** Always look for logical units of state and UI blocks to extract. Use custom hooks for complex state management and isolated components for logical UI sections.

## 2026-06-23 - [Memoizing derived state in ChatSidebar]
**Learning:** Memoizing derived state like 'safeMessages' not only prevents redundant O(N) normalization on every keystroke in a controlled input, but also stabilizes object identity. This prevents unnecessary triggerings of 'useEffect' hooks (e.g., for auto-scrolling) that depend on these objects.
**Action:** Always memoize derived objects/arrays in components with frequent re-renders (like those with text inputs) to maintain stable identities for downstream hooks and memoized children.
